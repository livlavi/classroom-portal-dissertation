## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run AllConnectEdu on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* A local web server environment like XAMPP (Windows/macOS/Linux), WAMP (Windows), or MAMP (macOS). XAMPP is recommended due to its bundled PHP and MariaDB.
* A modern web browser.

  
### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone or Download the Repository:**

    git clone: https://github.com/livlavi/classroom-portal-dissertation.git
    # Or, download the project ZIP file and extract it.
    

2.  **Place Project in Web Server Root:**
    Move the entire `AllConnectEdu` folder into your web server's document root directory.
    * **XAMPP (Windows):** `C:\xampp\htdocs\`
    * **XAMPP (macOS):** `/Applications/XAMPP/htdocs/`
    * (Adjust path if you're using WAMP, MAMP, or a different XAMPP installation path).

3.  **Database Setup:**
    * **Start your Apache and MySQL/MariaDB services** from your XAMPP/WAMP/MAMP control panel.
    * Open your database administration tool (e.g., **phpMyAdmin**, usually accessible via `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/` in your browser).
    * **Create a new database** named `classroom_management`.
    * **Import the database schema:** You will need a `database.sql` file (not included in the provided structure, but crucial for setup). Import this file into the `classroom_management` database using phpMyAdmin's "Import" tab or a command-line tool.

4.  **Configure Database Connection:**
    * Open `Global_PHP/db.php`.
    * Ensure the database connection details (host, database name, username, password) match your MariaDB/MySQL setup. For most XAMPP installations, the default is `username: root` and `password: (empty string)`.

### Accessing the Application

After completing the installation steps and starting your web server (e.g., Apache via XAMPP), open your web browser and navigate to:

http://localhost[:PORT]/Classroom%20Portal%20Dissertation/index.php

- Replace `[:PORT]` with your custom port number if you're not using the default.  
  - For example: `http://localhost:3000/Classroom%20Portal%20Dissertation/index.php`  
- If you're using the default Apache setup (usually port 80), you can skip the port and simply go to:  
  `http://localhost/Classroom%20Portal%20Dissertation/index.php`

This will take you to the main page of the application.
