# AllConnectEdu

**AllConnectEdu** is a full-featured classroom management platform designed to connect teachers, students, and parents in one integrated system. Built with PHP (8.2.12), MariaDB, JavaScript, Bootstrap 4.6, and AJAX, this system provides essential tools for teaching, communication, reporting, and parental engagement.

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- PHP 8.2.12 (tested on XAMPP)
- MariaDB 10.4.32 (Database: `classroom_management`)
- JavaScript + AJAX
- HTML5 / CSS3
- Bootstrap 4.6

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run AllConnectEdu on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* A local web server environment like XAMPP (Windows/macOS/Linux), WAMP (Windows), or MAMP (macOS). XAMPP is recommended due to its bundled PHP and MariaDB.
* A modern web browser.

  
### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone or Download the Repository:**

  --------DO IT LATER-------
      ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/AllConnectEdu.git](https://github.com/your-username/AllConnectEdu.git)
    # Or, download the project ZIP file and extract it.
    ```
    (Replace `https://github.com/your-username/AllConnectEdu.git` with your actual repository URL)

2.  **Place Project in Web Server Root:**
    Move the entire `AllConnectEdu` folder into your web server's document root directory.
    * **XAMPP (Windows):** `C:\xampp\htdocs\`
    * **XAMPP (macOS):** `/Applications/XAMPP/htdocs/`
    * (Adjust path if you're using WAMP, MAMP, or a different XAMPP installation path).

3.  **Database Setup:**
    * **Start your Apache and MySQL/MariaDB services** from your XAMPP/WAMP/MAMP control panel.
    * Open your database administration tool (e.g., **phpMyAdmin**, usually accessible via `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/` in your browser).
    * **Create a new database** named `classroom_management`.
    * **Import the database schema:** You will need a `database.sql` file (not included in the provided structure, but crucial for setup). Import this file into the `classroom_management` database using phpMyAdmin's "Import" tab or a command-line tool.

4.  **Configure Database Connection:**
    * Open `Global_PHP/db.php`.
    * Ensure the database connection details (host, database name, username, password) match your MariaDB/MySQL setup. For most XAMPP installations, the default is `username: root` and `password: (empty string)`.

### Accessing the Application

After completing the installation steps, open your web browser and navigate to:
`http://localhost/AllConnectEdu/`
